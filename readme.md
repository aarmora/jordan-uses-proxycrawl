# Jordan Uses Proxycrawl

This package has some sample code using [Proxycrawl](https://proxycrawl.com/). 

Proxycrawl offers many products to assist in web scraping, including a proxy for crawling and a tool that returns structured JSON of a website.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and run `npm i`. 

You will also need to get your tokens from Proxycrawl.com. You can sign up for a free account [here](https://proxycrawl.com/) and 
then get the tokens within the "Account Documentation" page. Place these tokens in an .env file or in the .sample.env file and rename it to .env.

After that, you just need to run `npm start`.
